    <p>
      The Mango Pest & Disease Guide is a web application being developed by
      Group 9 as part of our semester project for HIT237: Building
      Interactive Software. The primary goal of this project is to create an
      easy-to-use tool for mango growers. By the end of the semester, the
      application will enable users to calculate the level of surveillance
      effort required on their property to ensure they can reliably detect
      the presence of any pests or diseases.
